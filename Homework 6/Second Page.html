     <h1>Barry the Bear and the Coffee Shop Incident</h1>
     <h3> A short story by ChatGPT</h3>
     <p>Barry was just your average 600-pound grizzly with a deep love for two things: naps and espresso. Not coffee, mind you espresso. Barry had developed the taste after raiding a campsite and slurping an unattended mocha. It changed his life.</p>
     <p>One morning, Barry wandered into the small mountain town of Pinebucket and strolled right into **Clawfee House**, the local coffee shop. The barista, Kyle, dropped his oat milk.</p>
     <p>Can I help you? Kyle asked, slowly reaching for the bear spray.</p>
     <p>Barry grunted, then carefully pointed to the menu with one massive claw.</p>
     <p>Double espresso, Kyle whispered. Got it.</p>
     <p>To everyone's surprise, Barry sat politely at a corner table, paws folded, waiting.</p>
     <p>When the espresso was served double shot, extra hot Barry took one sip, let out a pleased snort, and gave Kyle a pawful of pinecones as payment.</p>
     <p>He left without mauling anyone.</p>
     <p>The next day, Clawfee House had a new chalkboard sign:</p>
     <p>Bear-friendly. Espresso served daily. No decaf. Ever.</p>
